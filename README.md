# Kikapu 
Kikapu provides food supply chain data-driven payment services that connects food producers (farmers), restaurants and university students (consumers)in Africa through a demand and supply simulation model.

## Overview
Kikapu provides data-driven payment services to connect famers, restaurants and customers (students in our case). Our platform connects food producers (farmers), restaurants, and consumers (university students) through a demand and supply simulation model. By leveraging data, we efficiently match the needs of farmers and restaurants with the demand for food, ensuring equitable distribution and affordable access to nutritious meals for consumers.

### FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM SIMPLIFIED
From the farm to folk through restaurants and hotels, we have made the process easy for producers, consumers and hotels. Our goal is to address the food insecurity in Africa by solving the root cause and vast challenges of fragmentation, food wastage and lack of financial empowerment for famers, food vendors and daily customers (especially students).

## Features
- Free Kikapu wallet: Streamlined and secure financial transactions when paying for your meals or when purchasing food stuffs from suppliers or farmers.
- Kikapu Credits: We understand financial constraints can hinder completion of transactions in the food supply chain, be it between customer and restaurant or restaurant and the supplier. Kikapu provides loans at very low interest to help complete the transactions.

- Dynamic and Decentralized Marketplace: Food suppliers and restaurants can trade openly and securely through demand and supply models. Suppliers can list their produce (as seller) in the platform and Restaurants can also advertise their requirements (as buyers). Payment is held in an escrow feature until the goods are delivered to the buyer and trade marked complete.

- Speedee Service System: This feature allows customers to access menus, make order and even reserve their preferred meals in advance. This feature streamlines the ordering process, reducing wait times and ensuring a pleasant dining experience for customers.
